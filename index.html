      <h2>Facts about Sea Otters</h2>

      <div class="parentOtterFacts">
        <p>Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are marine animals and are also a part of Mustelidae family.
           Other species include skunks, weasels, and badgers. They are the
           largest member of the Mustelidae family. Adult sea otters can grow
           up to 5 feet in length. Male sea otters weigh anywhere between 80
           and 100 pounds while female sea otters weigh anywhere between 50 and
           70 pounds. They are carnivorous, although sometimes omnivorous, animals.
           Their diet consists of a variety of marine invertebrates, including
           crustaceans, mollusks, abalone, sea urchins, and more. Females only
           give birth to one live young at a time.

      <h2>Why Sea Otters are the Cuttest Animals</h2>
      <div class="parentCuteOtters">
        <p>1. Did you know that sea otters are considered a Keystone Species?
          These little creatures are one of the few species of animals that prey
          upon sea urchins. Sea urchins are avid grazers of kelp, meaning that an
          overpopulation of sea urchins creates a lost of kelp forests in nearshore
          ecosystems that are crucial for a lot marine life. Imagine protecting
          your ecosystems, and letting a variety of life flourish, just by eating
          the foods that you like?
          </p>
          <div class="childKeystone"><img src="https://scontent-lga3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.18172-8/905442_10151516214608022_1690740525_o.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=9267fe&_nc_ohc=XG2lCUtSPfoAX89EXE9&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.xx&oh=00_AT_ZsCwNXM3hgmbsXy_u0A-wfZwsjPq87RAL85WyjinbFQ&oe=6226974C"></div>
        <p>2. Sea otters have the thickest fur out of all animal. Unlike other marine
          animals that rely on a blubber layer, such as whales and dolphins, sea
          otters rely on their dense, water-resitant fur to keep warm. They would
          often spend their days grooming their fur. Is that not a good pat? Oh
          such a good pat.
          </p>

             ></div>
        <p>3. Sea otter offsprings are known as pups. Aww...is that not just the
          cuttest name ever? They are actually the only species of otters to give
          birth in the water.
          </p>
          <div class="childPups"><img src="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190828153449-monterey-sea-otter-3-super-tease.jpg"
            ></div>
        <p>4. Otters are one of the few animals that use tools. Sea otters typically store a rock
          in the layer of skin underneath their armpits that they use as an anvil
          to break open the shells of their prey. Sea otters are actually the only
          marine mammals to use stone tools. Otter mammals that use tools include
          humans, primates, dolphins, and elephants. The aforementioned animals are
          known to be some of the smartest animals in the animal kingdom. The otters
          being compared to them probably makes them one of the cuttest, fuzziest, intelligent
          animals to ever floated on our planet.

        <p>5. Did you know that sea otters hold paws together to prevent themselves
          from drifting away while they sleep. They are afraid of losing their
          family members while they are sleeping or relaxing. If they are not holding
          hands, they will cover their eyes while they sleep.
          </p>

        <p>6. Otters actually love resting in groups, which are known as rafts.
          These rafts can have up to 1,000 otters. These groups are typically
          separated based on sex. They would actually wrap themselves with kelp
          to prevent themselves from floating away. Sea otters are the only species
          of otters to sleep in the water.

      <h2>The Future of Sea Otters</h2>
        <div class="parentFutureOtters">
          <p>The future of sea otters are looking a bit grim. They are classified
            as an endangered species. In the 18th century, sea otters were almost
            driven to extinctions thanks to the sea otter fur trade; however, their
            population rebounded following the passing of the Fur Seal Treaty in 1911.
            Now, the sea otter populations are at a decline again. There are numerous
            reasons for the decline, including oil spills and other coastal contaminants,
            predation, and food availability. Since they rely on their dense fur
            to keep themselves insulated, oiling reduces their ability to insulate,
            leading them to die of hypothermia. This does not include the averse
            side effects of ingesting the oil itself. Predation by white sharks, and
            sometimes orcas, have become a huge cause of concern. Specifically for
            southern sea otters, shark-bitten sea otters account for majority of
            sea otter mortality, more than all other accounts of mortality combined.
            </p>
          <p>Sea otters have expanded their range in recent years, due to the limited
            amount of food that has been available to them. Range expansion is also
            a critical factor for their recovery; unfortunately, these expansions are
            also where the shark-bite mortalities have been the greatest.
            </p>
          <p>With only 3,000 sea otters left in the wild today, conservations of these
            creatures have become increasingly important. There are numerous
            organizations working to research and conserve sea otters. In particular,
            the California Sea Otter Fund has raised donations that goes to the
            California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Coastal
            Conservancy to help research and converse sea otter populations. For
            Californians, line 410 on form 540, you can make tax-deductible donations
            to help protect the sea otters. For everyone, you can look into the
            numerous organizations dedicated to preserving these cute, fluffly species.
            </p>
          <p>Sea otters are some of the most unique species, being a highly intelligent
            keystone species that are vital to their ecosystem, it would be a tragedy
            if they were to no longer exist in this world.
